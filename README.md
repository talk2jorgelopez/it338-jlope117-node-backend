# it338-jlope117-node-backend
Assignment from thinkster.io for node express backend.

Part 1 Instructions
 
Implement the Thinkster Node.js backend in a C9 development container, but use an mlab database as the database rather than a local MongoDB.

Github repository for the selected backend is: https://github.com/gothinkster/node-express-realworld-example-app

This is the one I emailed about. I had issues with the link and built it from scratch.

I am attaching the MongoDB once it gets into Heroku. I am going to first upload local repository to GitHub then clone to Heroku.
